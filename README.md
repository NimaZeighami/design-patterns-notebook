## What are design patterns?
Think of design patterns as blueprints for solving common software design problems. They aren't finished code you can copy and paste, and they aren't strict rules you must follow.
Instead, they are proven templates(solution) that experienced developers have created over time to provide reliable, flexible solutions to challenges that come up again and again when building software.

- They are a shared vocabulary. Instead of explaining a complex design idea from scratch, you can just say, "Let's use a Singleton here," and other developers will instantly understand your plan.

- The goal is wisdom, not force. You learn patterns to understand when and why to use them, not to shoehorn them into every project. It's about knowing which tool to use for which job.

- An algorithm is like a cooking recipe—it gives you exact steps to follow. A design pattern is like a blueprint for a house—it shows you the overall structure and goal, but you decide the specific materials and exact construction order. Two houses built from the same blueprint can look very different on the inside
