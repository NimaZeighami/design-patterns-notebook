# DESIGN PATTERNS


# Basics


## What are design patterns ?

Think of design patterns as blueprint(a detailed plan or a template for how to build something) for solving common software design problems. They aren't finished code you can copy and paste, and they aren't strict rules you must follow.
Instead, they are proven templates(solution) that experienced developers have created over time to provide reliable, flexible solutions to challenges that come up again and again when building software.

- They are a shared vocabulary. Instead of explaining a complex design idea from scratch, you can just say, "Let's use a Singleton here," and other developers will instantly understand your plan.

- The goal is wisdom, not force. You learn patterns to understand when and why to use them, not to shoehorn them into every project. It's about knowing which tool to use for which job.

- An algorithm is like a cooking recipe—it gives you exact steps to follow. A design pattern is like a blueprint for a house—it shows you the overall structure and goal, but you decide the specific materials and exact construction order. Two houses built from the same blueprint can look very different on the inside

- A design pattern is a proven, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.


## How a Design Pattern is Born ?

Patterns aren't invented; they are discovered and named. It starts with a common problem that programmers face again and again. Over time, a particularly clever and effective solution to this problem emerges and gets reused by different developers across many projects. Eventually, someone recognizes that this specific solution is being used repeatedly to solve the same type of problem. They then document it, give it a name (like "Singleton" or "Observer"), and describe its structure and benefits. This process creates a shared blueprint that everyone can use and understand. So, a pattern is simply a proven solution to a recurring problem, standardized into a reusable template.


## Design Pattern VS Paradigms

- A Paradigm is the big-picture philosophy or style of programming. It's the set of rules and principles you follow. It's like choosing to build with Legos (object-oriented) vs. clay (functional) – the fundamental material and method are different.

-A Design Pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem within a paradigm. It's a specific, clever way to connect your Legos or shape your clay to solve a recurring design issue.


## What does the pattern consist of? (PATTERN FOR EACH DESIGN PATTERN)  

1. Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.

2. Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.

3. Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.

4. Code example in one of the popular programming languages (in this case Golang and TS) makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern
